      <h1 id="hdot">Equipment</h1>
      <p>We're sending you in with standard Avalon security employee equipment (a pistol and baton), however you may be able to procure additional equipment on location.</p>
      <h1>Stun Baton</h1>
      <p>The tried and tested life insurance policy, this should help you out, unless you're cornered into a wall. It has done its job the past 50 years, and is still reliable today. Other weapons are preferred.</p>
      <h1>Security Pistol</h1>
      <p>Nothing beats squeezing a trigger of a classic double-action diplomat to deliver your message.</p>
      <h1>Security "Blaster" PDW</h1>
      <p>This energy based automatic weapon is good for attacking from a distance, and is very reliable, but doesn't do too much damage.</p>
      <h1>Shotgun</h1>
      <p>Not much needs to be said. It explodes faces, looks cool, and packs one hell of a punch. Your best friend from out the door all the way to hell.</p>
      <h1>Auto-9</h1>
      <p>This gun does a great job at clearing rooms as well as your ammo supply. The power hungry beast is hard in your hands, but it fires so fast your enemies will become a new gore smoothie.</p>
      <h1>Plasma Gun</h1>
      <p>An experimental Avalon energy weapon that shoots giant globs of face-melting plasma. This thing gets hot though, and you'll need special protection to use it without becoming a boiling milkshake. Rechargeable.</p>
      <h1>Sentry Gun</h1>
      <p>Set and forget for as long as there's ammo. There are both portable and non-portable versions of this beast. The portable ones don't need a constant source to operate, but only hold 200 rounds, while the non-portable ones are much harder to destroy, and can fabricate their own ammo supply. Thank god for open source 3D printing!</p>
      <h1>Stimpack</h1>
      <p>It'll stop you from dying, at least if you only have a few cuts.</p>
      <h1>Medipack</h1>
      <p>It'll stop you from dying even further. Your backpack can store one and you can gradually use up the included supplies.</p>
      <h1>O<sub>2</sub> "Oz" Canister</h1>
      <p>Your environment suit is compatible with the Oz system air canisters that can partially refl your air supply. You might want to pack a few if you have to go 'outside'.</p>
      <h1>PDA</h1>
      <p>A handy device for keeping things in check. Also includes a handy messaging system and note logger. Handy!</p>
      <h3>There may be other undocumented devices, <i>make sure you double check each area to find them.</i></h3>
