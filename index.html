      <p>Xenotomb is a total conversion mod for GZDoom inspired by Aliens that has the player investigating alien infested corridors and hallways of a derelict cargo ship, uncovering the hidden truth behind the corporation that runs everything. The game takes inspiration from Alien Breed and Space Beast Terror Fright in their presentation and gameplay and will initially require a Doom II compatible IWAD0. to play, although a post release goal is to make the project eventually standalone. Gameplay will be similar to Doom with lite inventory, story-related and item based mechanics. Multiplayer of any sort is not planned.</p>
      <p>Xenotomb will be available as a .pk3 archive, a compressed file format readable by many ZDoom based source ports. One of the project goals is to eventually remove and/or replace all dependencies on resources from Doom II and make this a standalone IWAD, fully playable without needing any other game. In this case, the game will switch over to use GZDoom-GPL, and only the standalone version will continue to be supported. The mod will always be available for free, the full standalone game will be shareware. However for the time being, you can view our progress <a href="https://github.com/xenotomb/xenotomb">here.</a></p>
